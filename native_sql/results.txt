Findings for the queries and indexes:
    Query 1:
    - before the index:
        Planning Time: 0.335 ms
        Execution Time: 434.340 ms
    - The indexes:
        idx_mission_date_target_city, idx_air_force
    - after the index:
        Planning Time: 0.195 ms
        Execution Time: 21.697 ms
    - Explanation:
        the composite index on mission date and city accelerated the kibbutz,
        and the air force index accelerated the calculation of the missions.

    Query 2:
    - before the index:
        Planning Time: 0.233 ms
        Execution Time: 108.031 ms
    - The indexes:
        idx_airborne_aircraft, idx_target_country
    - after the index:
        Planning Time: 0.796 ms
        Execution Time: 33.063 ms
    - Explanation:
        The index on the number of planes accelerated the filtering,
        and the index on the country improved the performance during the kibbutz.

Conclusions:
    The use of appropriate indexes on key columns improved query performance considerably.
